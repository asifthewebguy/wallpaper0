# Wallpaper Application Refactoring Plan

This document outlines potential areas for refactoring that would yield significant performance gains and maintainability improvements in the wallpaper application.

## HIGH PRIORITY: Google Drive Integration âœ…

- [x] Implement Google Drive integration for image hosting
- [x] Create mapping system between local filenames and Google Drive file IDs
- [x] Modify image data generation script to use Google Drive URLs
- [x] Add fallback mechanism to local storage when Google Drive is unavailable
- [x] Update GitHub Actions workflow to handle Google Drive-hosted images
- [x] Set up Google Cloud project and enable Google Drive API
- [x] Generate credentials.json file for Google Drive API
- [x] Test uploading images to Google Drive
- [x] Create actual mapping file with real Google Drive file IDs
- [x] Generate API files with Google Drive URLs
- [x] Test the application with Google Drive images

## Image Loading and Optimization

- [x] Implement responsive image loading with different sizes for different devices
- [ ] Add proper lazy loading for images not in the current view
- [ ] Implement image compression and optimization in the generation script
- [x] Add fallback mechanisms for failed image loads
- [x] Add loading indicators during image transitions

## Code Structure and Organization

- [ ] Consolidate duplicate code between `js/app.js` and `js/github-pages-app.js`
- [ ] Create a shared core module that both versions can import
- [ ] Extract common functionality into reusable utility functions
- [ ] Implement a configuration-based approach to handle environment differences
- [ ] Convert to ES modules for better code organization

## API Structure and Caching

- [ ] Implement a more efficient API structure with fewer files
- [ ] Add proper HTTP caching headers for static resources
- [ ] Use service workers for offline capabilities and improved caching
- [ ] Consolidate the redirect mechanism for image files
- [ ] Optimize the JSON data structure for faster parsing

## Error Handling and User Experience

- [ ] Implement comprehensive error handling with user feedback
- [ ] Add loading states and transitions between images
- [ ] Provide fallback mechanisms when images fail to load
- [ ] Improve UI feedback during loading and transitions
- [ ] Add visual indicators for navigation actions

## Build and Generation Process

- [ ] Implement a modern build system (webpack/Vite/Parcel)
- [ ] Add asset optimization during build (minification, bundling)
- [ ] Implement image processing during build (resizing, optimization)
- [ ] Add source maps for better debugging
- [ ] Create development and production build configurations

## Testing Infrastructure

- [ ] Add unit tests for core functionality
- [ ] Implement integration tests for the API endpoints
- [ ] Add validation for generated files
- [ ] Set up continuous integration testing
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for critical user flows

## Modern JavaScript Features

- [ ] Implement ES modules for better code organization
- [ ] Use modern JavaScript features (optional chaining, nullish coalescing)
- [ ] Implement proper state management
- [ ] Add TypeScript for better type safety and developer experience
- [ ] Refactor to use async/await consistently

## Accessibility Improvements

- [ ] Enhance keyboard navigation beyond arrow keys and 'r'
- [ ] Add proper ARIA attributes for screen readers
- [ ] Implement better contrast for UI elements
- [ ] Add image descriptions for screen readers
- [ ] Ensure proper focus management for keyboard users

## Performance Optimizations

- [ ] Implement image preloading for adjacent images
- [ ] Optimize transition animations for smoother experience
- [ ] Reduce unnecessary DOM operations
- [ ] Implement debouncing for rapid user interactions
- [ ] Add performance monitoring and analytics

## GitHub Actions Workflow

- [ ] Enhance GitHub Actions to include testing
- [ ] Add image optimization step to the workflow
- [ ] Implement automatic versioning
- [ ] Add deployment previews for pull requests
- [ ] Improve error reporting in automated processes
